This folder contains the code for the Lexical Analyser.

## Designing a scanner for C language
We have used Flex to perform lexical analysis on a subset of the C programming language. Flex is a lexical analyzer generator that takes in a set of descriptions of possible tokens and produces a C file that performs lexical analysis and identifies the tokens.
